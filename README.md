- User can specify 3 air mixtures: air, EANx32 and EANx36.
- The Dive Planner only holds transient state to display to the user information about the dive and informs the diver if a planned dive is relatively safe regarding nitrogen exposure only.
- Information provided includes ending pressure group, safety stop requirement, no deco limit and recommended pre-flight surface interval.
